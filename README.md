## About This Project

This portfolio serves as a central hub for my professional identity. It provides a comprehensive overview of my journey, including my educational background, technical skills, and a curated list of projects I have worked on. The primary goal is to present this information in a clear, accessible, and visually appealing manner.

The portfolio is divided into two main sections:
*   **Home Page**: A landing page that introduces me and highlights some of my key projects.
*   **About Page**: A detailed resume-style page that covers my objective, education, skills, projects, internship experience, and certifications.

## Key Features

- **Responsive Design**: The layout is fully responsive and optimized for a seamless experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Clean and Modern UI**: The design uses a minimalist aesthetic with a professional color palette and typography for excellent readability.
- **Two-Page Structure**: A simple and intuitive navigation system that separates the main introduction from the detailed information.
- **Project Highlights**: The homepage effectively showcases recent projects to immediately grab attention.
- **Detailed Resume**: The about page acts as a digital resume, providing all necessary information for potential employers and collaborators.

## Technologies Used

This project was built using fundamental front-end technologies:

-   **HTML5**: For the semantic structure and content of the website.
-   **CSS3**: For all styling, including layout, colors, fonts, and responsive design using media queries.
